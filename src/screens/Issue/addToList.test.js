    "Please refer to the [Halma Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-7GdliqS-4nWdG_WHHnPN9DJDiXyRpXKkIy2C36Df-s/edit?ts=5d711942#gid=770365634) sheet to see a more detailed breakdown of the current plan for Halma.\r\n\r\nThe below will be updated overtime to reflect the plan.\r\n\r\n# Launch Checklist\r\nThis list will continue to change and is meant to serve as conversation starter.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Setup redirects for broken links from V3** hivelearning/hive-native-app#1773\r\n- [ ] **Fix responsive image issues** https://github.com/hivelearning/hive-native-app/issues/1137\r\n- [ ] **Add ability to hyperlink text in a card** https://github.com/hivelearning/hive-native-app/issues/1518\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Completed\r\n- [x] **Add ability for internal employees to automatically be joined to a private group**\r\n- [x] **Post as user** #46 \r\nOrganisation admins should have the ability to create content as a different user.\r\n_This issue isn't completely resolved but for the Halma use case we have the ability to manually do this from interacting with GraphQL directly._\r\n- [x] **Turn off card creation for predefined groups**\r\n- [x] ~**Improvements to e-mails** #47~\r\nE-mails drive the majority of the traffic to the platform and currently under-perform against V3.\r\n- [x] ~**Use whitelabel colour for loading spinners** https://github.com/hivelearning/hive-native-app/issues/1850~\r\n- [x] ~**Migration Functionality** #36~\r\nWe should be able to successfully migrate the entire Halma organisation to V4 without issues, including user profiles, permissions, analytics and posts.\r\n- [x] ~**Enable card creation for members in groups** https://github.com/hivelearning/hive-native-app/issues/1847~\r\n- [x] ~**Improve profile, show users activity** #42~\r\nHalma think of the hub as a primary method for connecting people across their businesses. Profile is major feature for them.\r\n- [x] ~**Fix mobile web 'dead ends'** https://github.com/hivelearning/hive-native-app/issues/1781~\r\n- [x] ~**Support larger header logo with org name in** hivelearning/hive-native-app#1821~\r\n- [x] ~**Move featured content sections up one on homepage** https://github.com/hivelearning/hive-native-app/issues/1805~\r\n- [x] ~**Manage homepage** #21~\r\nOrganisation admins should have the ability to manage the featured items on the homepage. _SHORT TERM FIX ADDED_\r\n- [x] ~**Remove hardcoded BC references** hivelearning/hive-native-app#1709~\r\nHalma users should in no way see any references to BC either in e-mails or the app. Default card images, etc.\r\n- [x] ~**Update sort order for comments** hivelearning/hive-graphql#168~\r\n- [x] ~**Improving the post experience** #37~\r\nA large proportion of the Halma grads feedback revolves around improving the post experience when viewing, or creating. As such this piece of work is shaped to focus on resolving those concerns.\r\n- [x] ~**Keep users place in feeds** #43~ \r\n- [x] ~**Copy content** #38~\r\nWe should be able to copy a piece of content from one group to another, this would be a forked copy and changes in one would not reflect in the other.\r\n- [x] ~**Permissions** #31~\r\nUsers should not be able to view or have access to content they are not permitted to, especially in the case of a user not even being in the organisation. Group owners should also be allowed to co-manage the group with other group admins.\r\n- [x] ~**Unified App** #10, #17~\r\nUnified app must be launched into the respective app stores and be fully working for all use-cases. Typical users of the new app should not be able to tell they are using a new app aside from the new login flow which they should not see unless they logout. \r\n- [x] ~**Whitelabelling** hivelearning/hive-native-app#1269~\r\nHalma have asked for their branding to be more prominent across the platform in the white label design, including things like button colours. \r\n- [x] ~**Comments** #12, #26~ \r\nComments have to be in fully working order as per the current decided UX journey and able to take the scale and load of typical Halma comment usage.\r\n- [x] ~**Analytics**~\r\nWe should be able to continue to support Halma with the same level of data as we currently provide them regarding metrics and insights.\r\n- [x] ~**SAML Profile Fields**~\r\nWe'll also need the ability to migrate profile fields automatically when users login via SAML.",
